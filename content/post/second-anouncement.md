We are excited to announce that the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers is sponsering the hackathon! Tickets at 11,85 â‚¬ are now available for the hackathon via [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/billets-digital-geosciences-hackathon-73786843435).

The Digital Geosciences hackathon will bring together computer scientists, machine learning specialists and geoscience experts to explore new ideas for digitalization and automation in geophysical research, exploration and industrial production processes. Two principal questions are: 

* How can we use cutting edge machine learning and visualization techniques to extract new information about the subsurface?
* How can we use such processes to automate typical processes in geosciences industry end-to-end.

## Program

### Day 1 morning:

Introduction and networking - The hackathon will open with two to three short presentations covering themes from using Jupyter Hub / Notebooks, reproducible work flows, machine learning in geosciences. We will then present various project ideas.

### Day 1 afternoon:

Start hacking. Teams of 3+ people start to hack on the ideas they chose. We will try to encourage teams that cover a diverse range of skills.

### Day 2 morning: 

Open with 2 minute lighting talks on the state of projects. Continue to hack on the projects.

### Day 2 afternoon: 

Around 3 pm, we stop the hack session. Each team will present their solutions. We will announce the (1) best presentation, (2) most innovative ideas, (3) most diverse team and (4) most useful solution. 


## Target participants

The event is open to geophysicists and computer experts. We are keen to attract researchers and engineers from a broad range of fields, from software developers, data engineers, data scientists, petroleum engineers, geologists, and research scientists. Some experience in writing code is certainly helpful, but not a requirement. Beginners and professionals are welcome to join.
