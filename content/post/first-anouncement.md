We plan to host a two day hackathon at the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris on the 15th and 16th November 2019. This two day event will focus on solving problems related to digitalisation within the subsurface software stack. We wish to bring together data engineers, data scientists, petroleum engineers and geoscientists.
